# BannedScrapper
This program scrapes FINRA banned CPA data, as well as scraping for non-banned CPAs. The data is intended for use in academic statistical comparison of the two groups.

This program is written as a C# console application for Windows, developed and run on Windows 10, using Visual Studio 2017.

This program scrapes for all banned individuals, and then scrapes for the non-banned control group until there are more entries in the control group than in the banned group.
